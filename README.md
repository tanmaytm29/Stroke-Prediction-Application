# Stroke-Prediction-Application

* This is a predictive model application that uses Machine Learning algorithm in order to predict if a person is vulnerable to a 'Stroke'.
* The prediction is a result of a highly accurately trained machine learning model.
* The algorithm uses the input features provided by a user ( such as age, medical status, etc.) for almost accurate results.
* Having tried different ML algorithms such as logistic regression, k- nearest neighbours classification, support vector classification, decison trees and random forest classifier, the trained model gave best accuracy of 95% using logistic regression algorithm.
