                Here are some precautions you can take!!!!!
            </b>
        </h3>
        <div>
            <p> <b> 1) Lower Your Blood Pressure-</b> A normal blood pressure reading is lower than 120/80. If yours is
                regularly
                above 130/80, you might have high blood pressure, or hypertension.If you have high blood pressure, work
                with
                your doctor to keep your pressure in the healthy range. Medication and lifestyle changes, such as
                regular
                exercise and eating healthy, can help.
            </p>

            <p><b> 2)Stay Away From Smoking-</b>You double your risk of a stroke if you use tobacco. Nicotine in
                cigarettes
                raises
                blood pressure, and carbon monoxide in smoke lowers the amount of oxygen your blood can carry. Even
                breathing secondhand smoke can raise your chances of a stroke.Talk to your doctor about ways to quit
                smoking. Nicotine patches and counseling can help. Don’t give up if you don’t succeed the first time.
            </p>

            <p><b> 3)Manage Your Heart-</b>An irregular heartbeat, called atrial fibrillation (AFib), is behind some
                strokes
                caused
                by blood clots. AFib makes blood pool in your heart, where it can clot. If that clot travels to your
                brain,
                it can cause a stroke. You can have AFib because of high blood pressure, plaques in your arteries, heart
                failure, and other reasons.
                Medications, medical procedures, and surgery can get your heart back into normal rhythm. If you don’t
                know
                if you have AFib but feel heart flutters or have shortness of breath, see your doctor.</p>

            <p><b> 4)Control Your Diabetes-</b>High blood sugar can make you 2-4 times more likely to have a stroke. If
                it’s
                not
                managed well, diabetes can lead to fatty deposits or clots inside your blood vessels. This can narrow
                the
                ones in your brain and neck and might cut off the blood supply to the brain.
                If you have diabetes, check your blood sugar regularly, take medications as prescribed, and see your
                doctor
                every few months so they can keep an eye on your levels.</p>

            <p> <b> 5)Exercise-</b>Being a couch potato can lead to obesity, high cholesterol, diabetes, and high blood
                pressure --
                a recipe for stroke. So get moving. You don’t have to run a marathon. It’s enough to work out 30
                minutes, 5
                days a week. You should do enough to make you breathe hard, but not huff and puff. Talk to your doctor
                before you start exercising.</p>

            <p><b>6)Eat Better Foods-</b>Healthy eating can lower your risk of a stroke and help you shed weight if you
                need to.
                Load up on fresh fruits and veggies (broccoli, Brussel sprouts, and leafy greens like spinach are best)
                every day. Choose lean proteins and high-fiber foods. Stay away from trans and saturated fats, which can
                clog your arteries. Cut salt, and avoid processed foods. They’re often loaded with salt, which can raise
                your blood pressure, and trans fats.</p>

            <p><b>7)Watch the Cholesterol-</b>Too much of this can clog your arteries and lead to heart attack and
                stroke. Keep
                your numbers in the healthy range:

                Total cholesterol: under 200 mg/dL of blood
                LDL (bad) cholesterol: under 100 mg/dL
                HDL (good) cholesterol: above 60 mg/dL
                If diet and exercise aren’t enough to keep your cholesterol in check, your doctor may recommend
                medication.
            </p>

            <p><b>8)Don’t Ignore the Snore-</b>Loud, constant snoring may be a sign of a disorder called sleep apnea,
                which can
                make you stop breathing hundreds of times during the night. It can boost your chances of a stroke by
                keeping
                you from getting enough oxygen and raising your blood pressure.</p>

            <p><b>9)Take Your Meds-</b>If you’ve already had a stroke, make sure to take any medicine your doctor
                gives you to
                help prevent another one. At least 25% of people who have a stroke stop taking one or more of their
                drugs
                within 3 months. That’s especially dangerous because that’s when you’re most likely to have another
                one.</p>

            <p><b>10)An Aspirin a Day-</b>A low-dose aspirin every day may prevent strokes and heart attacks in
                people at higher
                risk. It acts as blood thinner, preventing blood clots from forming in arteries partly blocked by
                cholesterol and plaque. It’s not for everyone, though, so don’t start taking aspirin without talking
                to your
                doctor first.

                And don’t give someone an aspirin if they’re showing signs of stroke like slurred speech or a
                drooping face.
                It can make a hemorrhagic stroke worse. Instead, call ambulance right away.</p>

            <p style="font-size: xx-large;font-weight: bold;text-align: center;"> However these are just precautions
                please a doctor</p>
            <p style="text-align: center;font-size: xx-large;">Take Care :) </p>
